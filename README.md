The Texture Update pack
======

<div style="float:right"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/02/01/x2E3JcfH7ZOQdRe.png"></div>

Like the new textures in Minecraft 1.14 but don't play it because of the lack of mods? Then try this texture pack!<sup>[Java Edition Only]</sup>

(If you still haven't played 1.14 yet, or you haven't noticed the changes, [see it in Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft-zh.gamepedia.com/%E6%9D%90%E8%B4%A8%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0))

As you can learn from the repo name, this is the original texture pack, extracted from Minecraft 1.14 jar file, and deflattened to fit the pack format of Minecraft 1.12 (and older).

The pack is designed to work correctly in Minecraft 1.10 - 1.12.2, but it will probably work in older versions of Minecraft as long as you ignore the 'Not Compatible' warning.

Does not require rendering patches like Optifine (it doesn't matter if you are already using one).

(P.S. Looking for the texture pack from Minecraft Alpha? Get it [here](https://www.minecraftxl.com/nostalgia-craft-resource-pack/))

## Installation

First download the files. Then unzip it and find the `Texture Update` folder. Next, move the folder into the `resourcepacks` folder of your Minecraft. Finally, check the resourcepacks menu. If you can see the option of the texture pack like the one above, you are successful.

## Screenshots

I think I don't need to do this. Try Minecraft 1.14 or this pack by yourself.
